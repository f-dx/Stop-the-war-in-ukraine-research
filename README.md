#Stop-the-War-in-Ukraine Research

Open Research Project Dedicated to Non-Violent Termination of War in Ukraine

**Motivation**

The war in Ukraine, also known as the Russian-Ukrainian War, started on February 24, 2022, when Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. This is an absurd, non-effective, violent, and non-sustainable activity that is a bottleneck for the development of us, humans, as a civilization. We should stand for peace in Ukraine and invest resources in peace alternatives instead of weapons and destruction.

**Top 5 Downsides of the War in Ukraine:**

1. **Humanitarian Crisis**: The war has led to a massive humanitarian crisis, with millions of people displaced, injured, or killed. According to the United Nations, over 14 million people have been affected, with 3.3 million people internally displaced and 1.2 million refugees seeking asylum in neighboring countries.

2. **Economic Devastation**: The war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine's economy, with significant damage to infrastructure, industries, and agricultural production. The country has suffered an estimated $100 billion in losses, with GDP shrinking by over 10%. The war has also disrupted global trade, particularly in grains, and led to a significant increase in food prices.

3. **Environmental Disaster**: The war has resulted in significant environmental damage, with toxic waste and radioactive materials released into the environment. The shelling of industrial sites, oil refineries, and nuclear power plants has led to spills, leaks, and fires, contaminating soil, air, and water.

4. **Disruption of Global Security**: The war in Ukraine has significant implications for global security, with Russia's aggression threatening the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination. The conflict has also led to increased tensions between Russia and Western countries, with the risk of further escalation and miscalculation.

5. **Long-term Psychological Trauma**: The war has had a profound psychological impact on Ukrainian civilians, with many experiencing trauma, anxiety, and depression. The constant shelling, bombing, and displacement have created a sense of uncertainty and fear, affecting the mental health and well-being of an entire generation.

Other downsides of the war in Ukraine include:

* Destruction of cultural heritage sites and historical monuments
* Disruption of critical infrastructure, including energy and water supply systems
* Increase in organized crime and human trafficking
* Risks to nuclear safety and security
* Impact on regional and global stability, with potential spillover effects on neighboring countries

**Proposed Plan of Action**

Initiate a large-scale AI research project for information aggregation and analysis to find at least 500 non-standard peace agreement options. 

This includes:

* Social graph analysis of all involved stakeholders
* Data mining and data aggregation for statistical and semantic analysis
* Creating a range of possible generative strategies for reasoning and data analysis
* Creation of a full knowledge base and ontology to support the reasoning
* Finding connections and possible ways of resolution
* Identifying key strategies for conflict resolution in the shortest term
* Releasing the created dataset for other explorers
* Generating 50,000-100,000 scenarios with possible further outcomes
* Algorithmically select top 500 peace strategies to present in NATO, US, UK, EU parlamient, Ukraine and Russia.
* Making data publicly available
